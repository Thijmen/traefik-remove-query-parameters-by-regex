# Info

This middleware allows you to modify the query parameters to the service by removing some parameters by regex. You even can exclude some paths by regex too!

Please note that this is my first middleware and first project with Go. If you have any tips for improvements, please do open a MR and I am more than happy to take a look at it!

I had some great help with looking at previously created plugin. One plugin I learned the most from is https://github.com/kingjan1999/traefik-plugin-query-modification. If you are planning to create a middleware, make sure to check it out!
